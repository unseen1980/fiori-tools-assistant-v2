# Further Post-Generation Steps

To enable or modify certain default features for apps based on SAP Fiori elements, you can modify the `manifest.json` file and adapt the annotations, after you have generated the app.

Apart from this, you can also extend generated apps using the extension wizard in SAP Fiori tools. For more information, see [Configure Page Elements](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/047507c86afa4e96bb3d284adb9f4726.html). To extend generated apps manually, see [Extending SAP Fiori Elements-Based Apps](extending-sap-fiori-elements-based-apps-358cf25.md).

You have several options with which to manually enhance the generated app. They are described in the floorplan-specific configuration sections:

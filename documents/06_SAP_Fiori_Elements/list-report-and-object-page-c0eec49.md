# List Report and Object Page

The list report is typically used in conjunction with an object page.

The main use case when creating SAP Fiori apps is to use the list report in conjunction with an object page. While the list report lets users filter, view, and work with items \(objects\) organized in list \(table\) format, object pages let users work with objects, providing functionality to view, edit, and create objects.

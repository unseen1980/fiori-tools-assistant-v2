# Adapting the UI: List Report and Object Page

Application developers can extend and customize specific features of the list report and object page.

We recommend that you use [SAP Fiori tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US), which is a set of extensions for SAP Business Application Studio and Visual Studio Code, to adapt the list report and object page.

You can find details about how app developers can adapt the UI in SAP Fiori elements for OData V2 in the section below.

In SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, app developers adapt the UI using the manifest settings. You can search for features and navigate to the related documentation for more details in the [SAP Fiori Elements Feature Map](sap-fiori-elements-feature-map-62d3f7c.md).

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2

> ### Note:  
> Adapt the UI only for the use cases described here. Otherwise, you might experience issues regarding consistency, compatibility, or other problems, immediately or in future releases.

You can also use SAP Web IDE to extend and customize specific features of the list report and object page.

# Analytical List Page

The analytical list page \(ALP\) offers a unique way to analyze data step by step from different perspectives, to investigate a root cause through drilldown, and to act on transactional content.

You can use SAP Fiori elements to build apps that require visualization and reporting of data using filters, interactive charts, and other data points such as KPIs \(key performance indicators\).

The combination of transactional and analytical data using chart and table visualization lets you quickly view the data you need. This hybrid view allows an interesting interplay between the chart and table representations.

Configure the ALP to include the following use cases seamlessly on one page:

-   Related KPIs on the header area as KPI tags. These KPI tags also allow progressive disclosure and navigation through KPI cards.
-   Filter data sets used for the main content area with different filter modes. For example, visual filters provide an intuitive way of choosing filter values from an associated measure value.
-   Seamless navigation to applications from the content area and the KPI card area.
-   Customizing and sharing ALP as a page variant with other users.

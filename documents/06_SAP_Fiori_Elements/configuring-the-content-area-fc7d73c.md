# Configuring the Content Area

Visualize data from the main entity set and seamlessly navigate to an application. Define a valid `chart` or `LineItem` annotation to render content for the chart area and table area.



You can choose to view the main entity set data in the following view modes:

-   Table only
-   Chart only
-   Hybrid \(chart and table\)

## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2

If you've configured the content tile in the descriptor file, the `FilterableKPI` view appears along with the segmented buttons \(Hybrid/Chart/Table\) and the content area tile.

Configure the `contentTitle` property in the descriptor configuration file to add a title for the content area.



### Dynamic Page Header

The dynamic page header is pinnable when the app has a responsive table in desktops, hybrid, and â€˜M' size devices such as tablets. A pin toggle button is available allowing the header content to remain expanded when scrolling the page.

> ### Note:  
> For all other table types, the pin button is not available in an analytical list page.
> 
> Although the table is defaulted as responsive for all analytical list pages, the pin button is not available for 'S' size devices such as mobile phones.

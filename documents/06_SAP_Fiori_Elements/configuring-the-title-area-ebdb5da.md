## Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V2

In the header area, you can also view information related to the Key Performance Indicator \(KPI\).



### UI.KPI Annotation

Use the `UI.KPI` annotation to display KPIs on your analytical list page application. Define the descriptor configuration file with a qualifier and map it to the UI.KPI annotation. If this annotation is not configured, then the `UI.SelectionPresentationVariant` annotation with the same qualifier name takes effect.

We recommended using a single SAP-wide KPI gallery based on the KPIs generated by standard SAP KPI creation tools, such as the SAP Smart Business framework.

> ### Sample Code:  
> Descriptor setting
> 
> ```
> "KPIQuantity": {
>                 "model": "kpi",
>                 "entitySet": "SEPMRA_C_ALP_SlsOrdItemCubeALPResults",
>                 "qualifier": "KPIQuantity
> }
> 
> ```

To enable navigation for a KPI card, you need to define the semantic object, action, and KPI ID in the `UI.KPI` annotation. The KPI ID is passed to the target application as the `EvaluationId` for launching the smart business application.

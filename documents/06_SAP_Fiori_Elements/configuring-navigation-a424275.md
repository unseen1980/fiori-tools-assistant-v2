# Configuring Navigation

SAP Fiori elements control the navigation within an app \(internal navigation\) and the navigation to and from an app \(external navigation\).



General navigation aspects are listed in the [Navigation](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/concept/navigation/) section of the SAP Fiori Design Guidelines.

With SAP Fiori elements, the following navigation options are available and can be configured:

-   Internal navigation

    -   Standard navigation within an app


    For more information, see [Configuring Internal Navigation](configuring-internal-navigation-2c65f07.md).

-   External navigation

    An SAP Fiori elements app can be the app from which the navigation is triggered \(outbound\) or the target of the navigation \(inbound\). Of course, both can also be the case in the same navigation.

    -   Outbound navigation

        -   Using a URL

        -   Using a semantic object \(intent-based navigation\)

    -   Inbound navigation


    For more information, see [Configuring External Navigation](configuring-external-navigation-1d4a0f9.md).
